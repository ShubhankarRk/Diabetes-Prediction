# Diabetes-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in women using machine learning models. Leveraging a dataset of medical records, the project aims to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. By employing advanced algorithms, we aim to improve early detection and prevention.

# Features:
Dataset Analysis: Comprehensive exploration and preprocessing of a dataset containing 2000 records with 9 attributes.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various models including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

Evaluation Metrics: Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC.

Categorical Insights: Categorization of attributes like BMI and blood pressure for better interpretability.

# Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn

# Results:
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.67% with excellent sensitivity and specificity metrics.
