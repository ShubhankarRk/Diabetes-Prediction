# Diabetes-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in women using machine learning models. Leveraging a dataset of medical records, the project aims to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more. By employing advanced algorithms, we aim to improve early detection and prevention.
